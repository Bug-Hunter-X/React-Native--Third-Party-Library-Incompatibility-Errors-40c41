This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: incompatibility errors stemming from using third-party libraries. The `ThirdPartyLibBug.js` file shows an example scenario where an outdated or conflicting library causes build errors or runtime crashes.  The solution, `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js`, demonstrates how to identify and resolve the issue, usually by upgrading to a compatible library version or resolving dependency conflicts using package managers like npm or yarn.
