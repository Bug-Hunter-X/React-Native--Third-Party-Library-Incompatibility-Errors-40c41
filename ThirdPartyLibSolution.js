The solution usually involves carefully examining the error messages, checking for version compatibility in package.json, and using npm or yarn to update the problematic libraries to their latest compatible versions.  If conflicts persist, examine the library's documentation for troubleshooting or compatibility notes. You might need to adjust the package.json to resolve dependency conflicts manually.  Sometimes, it might be necessary to downgrade a library's version to find the best compatibility with your other dependencies. In some cases, switching to an alternative library entirely may be the best solution.
