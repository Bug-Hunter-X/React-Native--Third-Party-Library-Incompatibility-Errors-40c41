This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that is not compatible with the current version of React Native or its dependencies.  This often manifests as seemingly unrelated errors, especially when working with native modules or complex UI components. For example, using an outdated library could lead to build errors during compilation or runtime crashes with cryptic messages.
